# My-Journey-through-Coursera-s-Machine-Learning-Specialization
This repo represents my dedication to mastering machine learning. It includes notebooks with practical applications of algorithms like linear and logistic regression, neural networks, etc. You'll also find my certificates for each course in the specialization.
All in all, the repository pertains to the exhaustive effort and unwavering dedication that went into completing the machine learning specialization on Coursera. The repository comprises a collection of Jupyter notebooks that have been meticulously documented to showcase several popular algorithms such as linear regression, logistic regression, neural networks, and more. Furthermore, you will find step-by-step explanations of the codes in the practice labs, ensuring that you can follow along and gain an in-depth understanding of how each algorithm functions, however, replication of the results is not suggested.
