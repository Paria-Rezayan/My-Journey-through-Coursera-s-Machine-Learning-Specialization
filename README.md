# My-Journey-through-Coursera-s-Machine-Learning-Specialization 
This repository pertains to the exhaustive effort and unwavering dedication that went into completing the machine learning specialization on Coursera. The repository comprises a collection of practice labs in Jupyter notebooks that have been meticulously completed to showcase my understaing of popular ML algorithms such as linear regression, logistic regression, neural networks, and more. Furthermore, the files have been uploaded here to ensure that you can follow along and gain an in-depth understanding of how each algorithm functions given that the aforementioned algorithms fall within your field of intrest as well, however, replication of the results is not suggested. You'll also find my certificates for each course in the specialization in the Certificates folder. 
My special thanks to Andrew Ng and his team at deeplearning.ai.
