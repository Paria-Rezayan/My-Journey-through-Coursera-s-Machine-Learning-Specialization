# My-Journey-through-Coursera-s-Machine-Learning-Specialization 
This repository pertains to the exhaustive effort and unwavering dedication that went into completing the machine learning specialization on Coursera. The repository comprises a collection of Jupyter notebooks that have been meticulously completed to showcase my understainf of popular ML algorithms such as linear regression, logistic regression, neural networks, and more. Furthermore, you will find step-by-step explanations of the codes in the practice labs, ensuring that you can follow along and gain an in-depth understanding of how each algorithm functions, however, replication of the results is not suggested. You'll also find my certificates for each course in the specialization in the Certificates folder. My special thanks to Andrew Ng and his team at deeplearning.ai.
